# Virtual Escape Room - A Murder Mystery

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

This app is a MERN stack app that hosts virtual mystery and escape room games. The app was set up so that users can easily use existing components and pages to build their own game.

The initial game is a murder mystery where the player can navigate through the rooms in a mansion to find clues and interact with the suspects. To win, the player will need to correctly identify the murderer, the weapon, and the motive.
