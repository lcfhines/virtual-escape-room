      "description": "Upon entering the study, you are hit with the rich fragrance of mahogany and old books. The wall to your right is lined with bookshelves,containing a large variety of leather-bound books, with various artifacts interspersed amongst the shelves. On the opposite wall there is a large stone fireplace with a table in front situated between two large leather chairs. Atop the table is a pair of lowball glasses. The first glass has a smudge of red lipstick on the rim and appears to be only half-finished whereas the second is empty but some residue remains from a recently finished drink.  Lying between the glasses is a quill, bloodied at the top, but clean at the point. In front of the chairs, sprawled across the priceless oriental rug is the body of Jameson lying face up in a pool of blood. Opposite the door hangs a large portrait of the previous lady of the house. In front of the painting stands Sir Edmond, staring up at the painting swirling the remnants of his own drink in a glass. Situated below the painting is a large desk, scattered with documents. Upon closer examination it looks as though the documents have been rifled through and on top of the pile is a business document showing a huge monetary loss. Turning away from the desk one sees a length of wire lying on the ground curiously snaking throughout the room.",

The only thing you overhear before conversation ceases is Annabelle saying 'I never loved him.' The room itself is very busy. The walls are covered in seemingly anything and everything. On the wall in front of you there is a large clock with gold trim, the hands stuck on 8:55. Mounted on the wall to your left is a medieval shield with a single spear. To your right there is a glass door stove with a stack of logs beside it. Next to the logs is a wrought iron stand with fireplace tools hanging from it. Looking up at the ceiling there is a large chandelier. Scattered throughout the room is a variety of furniture. Sitting on a green velvet couch clasping steaming cups of tea are Annabelle and Elizabeth. On the table in front of them is a stack of letters, and a letter opener.",

There's a large variety of flora as far as the eyes can see. Stuck into a bed of roses and daises is a gardening spade. Leaning against the house is Jeremiah smoking a pipe, and staring at nothing in particular. To his left under a window is a bed of ferns that looks as though it has been trampled. At the far end of the gardens there's a headstone surrounded by petunias.",
