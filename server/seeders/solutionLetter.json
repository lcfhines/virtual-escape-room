I was keen to arresting you the second you were found with the body, and after throwing around such a baseless accusation against ______ there was no doubt in my mind that you slayed Mr. Holloway. We may not know how or why you killed him, but my suspicion is that you're simply a mal-adjusted dicontent not fit for participation in society. I pray every night for God to relieve you of your deviance so that you might understand your sins as you are dropped off a wooden platform straight into eternal damnation.",
